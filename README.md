## Music
Thanks for visiting my page. If you are looking for a
versatile upright or electric bassist you have come to the right
place! My experience includes more than a decade of freelance
jazz gigs, symphonic and chamber groups, pit orchestras, ethnic
dance bands, and so forth. I offer a complete range of skills,
including fluent sight-reading, improvisation, knowledge of the
standard jazz repertoire, and simply being easy to deal with.

I moved to Madison in 1997, and have played with numerous
local groups, on a regular or substitute basis.

By day, I am a senior staff scientist at the
Madison outpost of Thermo Fisher Scientific Corp., the world
leader in serving science. It's a great place to work, in a
wonderful town. I have a PhD in physics, 15 patents, and extensive experience
in development of optical and electronic instrumentation systems.

## Electronics and Speakers

Related to music, I have a bit of an electronics hobby. As I
accumulate results, if they are interesting, then I write them up
to share. Often, I find that writing a brief report helps me
critique my own ideas, and also attracts helpful comments that
improve my knowledge. Most of the files in this repository are related
to this interest.

## Where's all the stuff?

This repository is mainly just a pile of files. I just created it, and am still
working on organizing it. For now, all of the files are accessible by browsing the
[content](content) folder. Gradually, I will make it more readable and add navigation.
