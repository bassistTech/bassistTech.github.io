<h1>JFET bass preamp</h1>
<p>I enjoy looking at schematics for historical bass amps. It's interesting to look for possible relationships between the sound of amps, as described by bassists, and how they're actually designed.</p>

<p>Naturally it's impossible to overlook famous amps like the Ampeg SVT. The SVT actually looks like it was designed as a basic high fidelity amplifier, albeit using tubes at a time when solid state amps were making great strides.</p>

<p>So I decided to explore the idea of a preamp with similar functionality, but using JFETs instead of tubes. My circuit has: Gain, bass and treble, swept midrange, and an output volume control. It actually sounds quite good, but I'm on the fence about whether it deserves to be a product. Meanwhile, here are some details, including a picture of my hand built prototype. Not shown is a regulated power supply at about +20 Volts derived from a 24-Volt wall adapter.</p>

<p>Each of the 4 stages is based on a published circuit. You get to enjoy the puzzle of converting op amp circuits to their discrete equivalents.</p>
