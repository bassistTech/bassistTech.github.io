<h2>Drawings</h2>

My son drew these for me in Google Sketchup. These drawings are pretty minimally dimensioned. I strongly advise drawing them out yourself on graph paper and make sure you believe the dimensions. Not all of the views are dimensioned -- they're just to give a more complete picture of how the thing goes together. Also, I don't cut all of the pieces at once. I start with the innards and build my way out. Finally I attach the sides. My rationale is that small errors creep into my cuts, and I can correct them by cutting the following piees bigger or smaller as needed.
